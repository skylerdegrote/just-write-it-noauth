# Just Write It
A Writing Resource website for anyone interested in writing

### Author
My name is Skyler DeGrote. I am a writer, author and software engineer. I love learning and as I create this website I'm learning all new languages that I've never used before. For a list of them, see below.

### Languages Used
* PHP
* SASS
* Material Design Lite

### Future updates - User Authentication
* MySQL
* PHPmyAdmin

### The Plan
I plan to include lots of things on this website that have to do with writing. First and foremost though, I must mention that I am a fiction writer so I know nothing about non-fiction writing. All the resources that I post to this website are fiction-writing based.
This is why I am going to open it up to the users! As a member, you'll be able to submit resources, blog posts, comment on posts, and much more! I'm also going to attempt to code a discussion board area for members to talk about their projects.

###The Resources Included
* The Write Practice
* Writer's Digest (future addition)
* Write To Done (future addition)

###Step by Step How To's Included
* How to use Scrivener Effectively
* What is a scene vs what is a chapter
* How to build a main character
* How to build non-main characters with the amount of detail you may still need in your book
* How to design a setting and use it well (future addition)
* How to write great dialogue (future addition)
